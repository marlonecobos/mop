Description: A set of tools to perform the multiple versions of the Mobility
    Oriented-Parity metric. This multivariate analysis helps to characterize 
    levels of dissimilarity between a set of conditions of reference and another
    set of conditions of interest. If predictive models are projected to 
    conditions different to the ones in which models were calibrated (trained),
    this metric helps to identify projection conditions that differ 
    substantially from those of calibration. These tools are implemented 
    following principles proposed in Owens et al. (2013) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.011>, and expanded to obtain more detailed 
    results that help with interpretations.
