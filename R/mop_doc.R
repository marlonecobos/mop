#' mop: Mobility Oriented-Parity Metric
#'
#' @description
#' `mop()` contains a set of tools to perform the Mobility Oriented-Parity metric,
#' which helps to compare a set of conditions of reference versus another set of
#' of interest.
#'
#' @details
#' The main goals of the MOP metric are to explore conditions in the set of
#' interest that are non-analogous to those in the reference set, and to
#' quantify how different conditions in the set of interest are. The tools
#' included here help to identify conditions outside the ranges of the
#' reference set with greater detail than in other implementations. These tools
#' are based on the methods proposed by Owens et al. (2013)
#' <doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.011>.
