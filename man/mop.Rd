\title{Analysis of extrapolation risks using the MOP metric}
\usage{
mop(m, g, type = "basic",  calculate_distance = FALSE,
    where_distance = "in_range", distance = "euclidean",
    scale = FALSE, center = FALSE, fix_NA = TRUE,
    percentage = 1, comp_each = 2000, rescale_distance = FALSE,
    parallel = FALSE, n_cores = NULL, progress_bar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a \code{SpatRaster} or matrix of variables representing a set of conditions
of reference (e.g., conditions in which a model was calibrated).
If a matrix is used, each column represents a variable.}

\item{g}{a \code{SpatRaster} or matrix of variables representing a set of conditions
of interest for which dissimilarity values and non-analogous conditions will
be detected (e.g., conditions in which a model is projected). Variable names
must match between \code{m} and \code{g}.}

\item{type}{\code{character}, type of MOP analysis to be performed. See \code{Details}
for options.}

\item{calculate_distance}{\code{logical}, whether to calculate distances
(dissimilarities) between \code{m} and \code{g}. The default, FALSE, runs
rapidly and does not detect dissimilarity levels.}

\item{where_distance}{\code{character} where to calculate distances, considering
how conditions in \code{g} are positioned in comparison to the range of
conditions in \code{m}. See \code{Details} for options.}

\item{distance}{(character) how distances are calculated, \code{euclidean} or
\code{mahalanobis}
Valid if \code{calculate_distance = TRUE}.}

\item{scale}{scaling options \code{logical} or \code{numeric-alike} as in
\code{\link[base]{scale}}.}

\item{center}{\code{logical} or \code{numeric-alike} center options as in
\code{\link[base]{scale}}.}

\item{fix_NA}{\code{logical} whether to fix the layers so cells with NA values
are the same in all layers. Setting to FALSE may save some time if the rasters
are big an have no NA matching problems.}

\item{percentage}{\code{numeric} percentage of \code{m} closest conditions used to
derive mean environmental distances to each combination of conditions in \code{g}.}

\item{comp_each}{\code{numeric} number of combinations in \code{g} to be used for
distance calculations at a time. Increasing this number requires more RAM.}

\item{rescale_distance}{\code{logical} whether or not to re-scale distances 0-1.
Re-scaling prevents comparisons of dissimilarity values obtained from runs with
different values of \code{percentage}.}

\item{parallel}{\code{logical} should calculations be performed in parallel
using \code{n_cores} of the computer. Using this option will speed up the
analysis but will demand more RAM.}

\item{n_cores}{\code{numeric} number of cores to be used in parallel processing.
If \code{parallel = TRUE} and \code{n_cores = NULL} (all CPU cores on current host - 1)
will be used.}

\item{progress_bar}{(logical) whether to show a progress bar.}

\value{
A object of class \code{\link{mop_results}} containing:
\itemize{
\item \strong{summary} - a list with details on the data used in the analysis:
\itemize{
\item \emph{variables} - name of variables considered.
\item \emph{calculate_distance} - value according to the argument
\code{calculate_distance}.
\item \emph{distance} - option of distance used.
\item \emph{percentage} - percentage of \code{m} used as reference for
distance calculation.
\item \emph{type} - type of MOP analysis performed.
\item \emph{fix_NA} - value according to the argument \code{fix_NA}.
\item \emph{N_m} - total number of elements (cells with values or valid
rows) in \code{m}.
\item \emph{N_g} - total number of elements (cells with values or valid
rows) in \code{g}.
}
\item \strong{mop_distances} - if \code{calculate_distance} = TRUE, a SpatRaster or
vector with distance values for the set of interest (\code{g}). Higher values
represent more dissimilarity compared to the set of reference (\code{m}).
\item \strong{mop_basic} - a SpatRaster or vector, for the set of interest,
representing conditions in which at least one of the variables is
non-analogous to the set of reference. Values should be: 1 for non-analogous
conditions, and NA for conditions inside the ranges of the reference set.
\item \strong{mop_simple} - a SpatRaster or vector, for the set of interest,
representing how many variables in the set of interest are non-analogous to
those in the reference set. NA is used for conditions inside the ranges of
the reference set.
\item \strong{mop_detailed} - a list containing:
\itemize{
\item \emph{interpretation_combined} - a data.frame to help identify combinations
of variables in \emph{towards_low_combined} and \emph{towards_high_combined} that
are non-analogous to \code{m}.
\item \emph{towards_low_end} - a SpatRaster or matrix for all variables
representing where non-analogous conditions were found towards low values
of each variable.
\item \emph{towards_high_end} - a SpatRaster or matrix for all variables
representing where non-analogous conditions were found towards high
values of each variable.
\item \emph{towards_low_combined} - a SpatRaster or vector with values
representing the identity of the variables found to have non-analogous
conditions towards low values. If vector, interpretation requires the use
of the data.frame \emph{interpretation_combined}.
\item \emph{towards_high_combined} - a SpatRaster or vector with values
representing the identity of the variables found to have non-analogous
conditions towards high values. If vector, interpretation requires the
use of the data.frame \emph{interpretation_combined}.

\description{
Analysis to calculate the mobility-oriented parity metric and other
sub-products to represent dissimilarities and non-analogous conditions
when comparing a set of conditions of reference (\code{m}) against another
set of conditions of interest (\code{g}).
}
\details{
\code{type} options return results that differ in the detail of how non-analogous
conditions are identified.
\itemize{
\item \strong{basic} - makes calculation as proposed by Owens et al. (2013)
\url{doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.011}.
\item \strong{simple} - calculates how many variables in the set of interest are
non-analogous to those in the reference set.
\item \strong{detailed} - calculates five additional extrapolation metrics. See
\code{mop_detailed} under \code{Value} below for full details.
}

\code{where_distance} options determine what values should be used to calculate
dissimilarity
\itemize{
\item \strong{in_range} - only conditions inside \code{m} ranges
\item \strong{out_range} - only conditions outside \code{m} ranges
\item \strong{all} - all conditions
}

When the variables used to represent conditions have different units,
scaling and centering is recommended. This is only valid when Euclidean
distances are used.
